This project is developed in verilog to display "dE0" on 7-segment display on DE0 FPGA board.

The project requires to complete in the following steps:
step1: Fisrt create 2x1 multiplexer.
step2: By utilizing 2x1 MUX to implement 3x1 MUX. 
step3: Next, implement 2-input 3x1 MUX based by utilizing previous designs.
step4: Apply d, E and 0 as input of 3x1 MUX, and send any one of them at output by setting sel = 00, 01, 10.
step5: Shift the characters 'd', 'E', and '0' using sel = 00, 01, 10 and so on.

Note:   1. implement just a combinational circuit.
        2. Use data flow modelling to implement MUX.
